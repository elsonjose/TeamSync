## Fixed Warnings

- Added the required keyword to classes ensuring that the property will be initialized by constructor or by the object initialization.
- We can also remove the warning by specifying that those properties will not be null.

## Reading From AppSettings -- Options Pattern

In order to read from appsettings,

1. Create a model to match the section in appsetings.json.
2. During dependency injection use the following code.

```
services.Configure<Model>(configuration.GetSection(<SecionName>));
```
3. Packages used are 
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
- Microsoft.Extensions.Options.ConfigurationExtensions

## Add another layer of security during development
We can use dotnet user-secrets.
