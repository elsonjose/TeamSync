## CQRS & Mediator
CQRS allows splitting of responsibility between command and querys. 
- Command : If states or data are modified in the request
- Query : If states or data are not modified.

If we keep on using services, then all commands and queries in the controller will reside in the service files. Over time this will be difficult to manage. Hence we will be splitting them based on feature. This allows each controller endpoint to have a separate file and improving readability.
