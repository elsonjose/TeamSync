## Adding MediatR

Decided to move all base paths to ApiController where the mediator is initialized using IServiceCollection from the httpContext. This allows to get services without contructor dependency injection. [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vRBQ1Ylu_k)

### Note
The custom operatingFilter OpenApiParameter property name should not have special characters. In my case the TimeZoneOffsetFilter OpenApiParameter name was 'TimeZone Offset'. Swagger execution failed due to this.
